Tactical Grid - A Battlecode Planner
Hi guys, this is my open source battlecode planner! It has multiple tools including waypoints, text, drawing, and dynamic placing of units and maps!

But what makes this project different is that it supports multiple users annotating and editing at the same time, all at once!

How to use:
All you have to do is upload a map (image so take a screenshot of any map not .bc26 file) and unit (robot) images (take a screenshot of all the game units you are experimenting with). You should also make a blank unit (tiny screenshot of map tiling) to block out starting units that appear on the map. Then you are ready to start annotating and planning alongside team members in real-time

Features:
Pen tool - you can pick any colour and use it to draw on the map
Erasor tool - erases user objects
Line and arrow tool - More annotation
Zooming tool - Buttons, touchpad, and ctrl+/- works on the actual map (not website itself)
Strategy section where you can type notes about your strat and share with team members
Map elements - Markers, text annotations, and unit icons
Layers - Map (grid) layer,, units layer, and drawings layer
Save section, where you can download a photo of your annotations

Most importantly - Collaboration mode where you can share a project id to collaborate in real time (no delay, all edits happen immediately). This can also be used to save work for later
