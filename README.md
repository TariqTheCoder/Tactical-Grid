# Tactical Grid – A Battlecode Planner

Hi guys! This is my **open source Battlecode planner**.  
It has multiple tools including **waypoints, text, drawing**, and **dynamic placing of units and maps**.  

What makes this project different is that it supports **multiple users annotating and editing at the same time, all at once!**

---

## How to Use

1. **Upload a map** – Use an image (screenshot of any map; not a `.bc26` file).  
2. **Upload unit (robot) images** – Screenshots of all the game units you are experimenting with.  
3. **Create a blank unit** – A tiny screenshot of map tiling to block out starting units that appear on the map.  
4. **Start annotating** – You’re ready to plan alongside team members in **real-time**.

## Features

- **Pen Tool** – Pick any color to draw on the map.  
- **Eraser Tool** – Erase user objects.  
- **Line and Arrow Tool** – For advanced annotations.  
- **Zooming Tool** – Works on the map itself; use buttons, touchpad, or Ctrl + / -.  
- **Strategy Section** – Type notes about your strategy and share with team members.  
- **Map Elements** – Add **markers, text annotations, and unit icons**.  
- **Layers** – Separate layers for **grid**, **units**, and **drawings**.
